# kulfi-bot
Kulfi Bot is a Python-based chatbot that can learn and remember responses permanently.
It saves all learned replies in a JSON memory file, allowing the bot to grow smarter every time you talk to it.
This project demonstrates file handling, JSON storage, loops, conditionals, and custom chatbot logic.
